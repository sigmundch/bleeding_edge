TodoMVC
-------

This directory contains a port of the TodoMVC app (www.todomvc.com) to Dart
using our webcomponents polyfill and the no-wrappers dart2js prototype swizzling
webcomponents implementation. 

To pull down necessary packages, run

pub install

and then to compile, run

dart2js app.dart -oapp.js

(where dart2js is the version of the compiler in THIS repo --
we need the experimental web components support that lives here).
Now open index.html in a browser and you're off to the
races.
