TodoMVC
-------

This directory contains a port of the TodoMVC app (www.todomvc.com) to Dart
using our webcomponents polyfill and the no-wrappers dart2js prototype swizzling
webcomponents implementation. 

Once you have the compiler, run

pub install

to pull down necessary packages, and then run

dart2js app.dart -oapp.js

to compile the app (where dart2js is the version of the compiler in THIS repo --
we need the experimental web components support that lives here).
Now open index.html in a browser and you're off to the
races.
