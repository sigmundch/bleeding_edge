TodoMVC
-------

This directory contains a port of the TodoMVC app (www.todomvc.com) to Dart
using our webcomponents polyfill and the no-wrappers dart2js prototype swizzling
webcomponents implementation. To compile this app, you will need the
experimental branch of dart2js located here:

https://github.com/samhopkins/bleeding_edge

but soon to be located at

https://github.com/sigmundch/bleeding_edge

Once you have the compiler, run

pub install

to pull down necessary packages, and then run

dart2js app.dart -oapp.js

to compile the app. Now open index.html in a browser and you're off to the
races.
