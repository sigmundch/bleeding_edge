# Run this test manually to verify that the fixnum library produces
# the same results as native ints on a set of directed and random inputs.
# Skip it when runnimng automated tests because it times out.  This
# test only makes sense on runtimes that support 64-bit integer
# arithmetic natively, i.e., the VM.
